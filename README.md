# MFIN3 - Econometrics - Lab and Quiz solutions in R
Judge Business School, University of Cambridge

## Introduction

- This repository contains R solutions for each Lab and Quiz from the 2019/2020 MFIN3 Econometrics course
- I will be periodically updating the repository as I write up more of the solutions

## How-To

### Getting Started With R

- I recommend this [DataCamp - Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course to get familiar with R syntax
- Tufts University Data Lab have produced a thorough introduction to RStudio which provides an introduction to the interface - [R and RStudio Basics](https://sites.tufts.edu/datalab/files/2018/04/R_RStudio_Basics.pdf)

### Installing R

- You need to install R itself (the binary) - [Link](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- You need to install RStudio (the programming editor and interface to R) - [Link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Running Solutions (Awaiting first solutions to be posted as of 11<sup>th</sup> Feb 2020...)

- Each solution is in its own appropriately named file
- Each file uses a series of packages which will need to be installed - if you're using RStudio you will be prompted to install these automatically
- Each solution has been carefully commented and laid out and should prove to be self-explanatory
